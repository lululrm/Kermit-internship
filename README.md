# Kermit-internship – Analysis of animal life histories

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to statistically analyze the relationships between life history strategies and various biological variables. The main objectives are:
- To perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on life history traits to build a Life History Index (LHI), representing the fast–slow strategy gradient
- To conduct statistical analyses on the LHI and explore its correlations with other biological parameters
